[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) is a popular free SFTP and FTP client for Windows, a powerful file manager that will improve your productivity. It offers an easy to use GUI to copy files between a local and remote computer using multiple protocols: Amazon S3, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP or WebDAV. Power users can automate WinSCP using .NET assembly. WinSCP is available in English and many other languages.

To build WinSCP you need:
- [Embarcadero C++ Builder XE6 Professional](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder).
- [Build Tools and Agents for Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (for C# 7.0)
- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) (store it to `buildtools/tools/nasm.exe`)
- [Object file converter](https://www.agner.org/optimize/#objconv) (store it to `buildtools/tools/objconv.exe`)
- Build MFC (see [`readme_mfc.txt`](readme_mfc.txt)).

To build WinSCP from source by yourself, modify and use [`build.bat`](build.bat) in root folder.
